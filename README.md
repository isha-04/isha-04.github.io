This repository contains the code for my portfolio website, https://isha-04.github.io/.<br>
The original html, css, and php were acquired from a free StyleShout theme found [here](https://styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/). <br>
It was a lot of fun tweaking the HTML to make the template my own. I learned a lot about HTML and CSS in the process of making this site.
